Converting and summarizing sentences in a document into a graph structure

Desktop application was developed in the project. The document is loaded. Then it turns the sentences into a graph structure and visualizes this graph structure. Each sentence represents a node. The semantic relationship between the sentences is established, the sentences are scored. Afterwards, a summary is made according to the scores. Its similarity to the actual summary is measured by the “ROUGE” scoring.
